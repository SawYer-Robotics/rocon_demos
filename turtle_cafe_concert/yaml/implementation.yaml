# Concert client tuples are of the platform-system-robot-name-app where
# the name is just a placemarker for the eventual concert client name.
# All other parts of the tuple are fixed.
#
# Development is easy to restrict if you just comment out the nodes - 
# you don't need to comment out the topics, actions or edges
